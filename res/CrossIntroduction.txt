DESCRIPTION:
Welcome to the cross tutorial. 
The method you will be learning is a beginners' variation of the CFOP (Cross-F2L-OLL-PLL) method.
The first step in this beginners' method is the 'Cross'. In the simulation window, you can see example of a cross on the white face.
A cross consists of four solved edges with a common colour. In this example, the white cross has been solved since the White-Green, White-Red, White-Blue, and White-Orange edges are all solved. 
You can solve the cross on any face (White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Green, or Blue), but the most popular colour is white, so we will stick with this colour.
The basic method for solving a single cross piece is:
1. Move the edge so that one sticker is touching the matching centre (e.g. the Red sticker of the White-Red edge is touching the Red centre).
2. Perform the appropriate move in order to make the other sticker (White) touch the (White) centre without affecting step 1.

DESCRIPTION:
Let's look at an example of solving a piece of the cross.
Look at the White-Red edge, if we perform the move F', we will solve the edge.
Try performing the move F' ('g' on your keyboard) to solve the White-Red edge.
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
w-r
HINT:
Perform F'
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
F'
EXPLANATION:
The White-Red edge needs to go between the 'White' and 'Red' centres. We can see the Red sticker of the White-Red edge is adjacent to the Red centre, so all we need to do is match up the White sticker with the White centre by performing F'.

DESCRIPTION:
Here, the White-Red edge is at the Down-Front position. We can solve it using D R2.
Try performing the moves D R2 ('s i i' on your keyboard) to solve the White-Red edge.
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
w-r
HINT:
Perform D R2
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
D R2
F2 U'
EXPLANATION:
Performing D lines up the Red sticker of the edge with the Red centre. Then all we need to do is perform R2 to line up the White edge as well.
