//White-Red Edge - ENABLE
SCRAMBLE:
B2 F' U B' F L' R U' B2 F L R2 D' U2 L2 B R2 D U' F2 D L2 R2 U R
DESCRIPTION:
Find the White-Red edge and try to solve it in two moves.(Rotations are not counted as moves).
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
w-r
HINT:
Look for a way to insert the edge into the top layer with white facing top, then try to solve it by doing a U move.
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
B U
y R U
y' L U
y2 F U
EXPLANATION:
You can insert the White-Red edge into the U face (with White facing upwards) by performing B.
Now that it is in the U face, you can solve it by performing U.

//White-Green edge - ENABLE
SCRAMBLE:
B2 F' U B' F L' R U' B2 F L R2 D' U2 L2 B R2 D U' F2 D L2 R2 U R B U y
DESCRIPTION:
Find the White-Green edge and try to solve it in three moves. (Rotations are not counted as moves).
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
w-r
w-g
HINT:
The White-Red edge is already solved, so make sure to solve the White-Green edge RELATIVE to the White-Red edge.
Move the White-Red edge to a position that will allow you to insert the White-Green edge correctly.
You could move the White-Green edge into the bottom layer and then move it under its destination and insert it correctly.
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
U2 R U2
F2 L' F2
R' D2 L2
EXPLANATION:
The White-Green edge needs to go to the position that is clockwise from the White-Red edge.
We can insert the White-Green edge into the U face (with White facing upwards) by performing R, but first we need to move its destination by performing U2.
So, move the destination by performing U2, insert the edge by performing R, then move the destination back by undoing U2.

//White-Orange edge - ENABLE
SCRAMBLE:
B2 F' U B' F L' R U' B2 F L R2 D' U2 L2 B R2 D U' F2 D L2 R2 U R B U y U2 R U2
DESCRIPTION:
Find the White-Orange edge and try to solve it in two moves. (Rotations are not counted as moves).
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
w-r
w-g
w-o
HINT:
The White-Orange edge is not oriented correctly (it does not have White on top), so fix its orientation.
You can move the White-Orange edge into the middle layer and then insert it.
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
R B
y F R
y2 L F
EXPLANATION:
The White-Orange edge is not oriented correctly, so you have to get it out of the top layer by performing R.
After you perform R, the edge can be inserted normally with the move B.

//White-Blue edge - ENABLE
SCRAMBLE:
B2 F' U B' F L' R U' B2 F L R2 D' U2 L2 B R2 D U' F2 D L2 R2 U R B U y U2 R U2 R B
DESCRIPTION:
Find the White-Blue edge and try to solve it in three moves. This one is difficult, so take your time. (Rotations are not counted as moves).
EXPECTED FINAL STATE:
cross
HINT:
The White-Orange edge is not oriented correctly (it does not have White on top), so fix its orientation.
You can move the White-Orange edge into the middle layer and then insert it.
OPTIMAL SOLUTION:
F' R F
EXPLANATION:
By performing F', you can then insert the White-Blue edge by performing R. When you perform F', you unsolve the White-Red edge, but we can just resolve it by undoing F', i.e. by performing F.
